# Poker
A poker game built with [socket-io](https://socket.io) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org)

## Usage
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Planned Implementations
* Implement the betting process
  * Functions for fold, check/call, bet/raise
* Improve UI and responsive design
  * Considering dark theme?
  * Need to create a new view for holding waiting players
* Implement MongoDB database

## Known Issues
The current flow has a lot of bugs that need to be addressed. After developing a minimal viable product, I plan on looking into some of the following aspects of this project.
* Implement more efficient error-checking/handling
* Implement unit tests
* Redesign architecture to remove global variables and improve encapsulation principles
* Improve application security
